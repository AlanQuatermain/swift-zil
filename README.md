# Swift ZIL - Interactive Fiction Development Environment

A complete development environment for interactive fiction using ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) and the Z-Machine virtual machine, implemented in Swift.

## Overview

This project provides a modern Swift implementation of the classic ZIL toolchain used to create interactive fiction games like Zork, Enchanter, and other Infocom classics. It includes a compiler, assembler, and virtual machine that can build and run Z-Machine story files across all supported versions (3, 4, 5, 6, and 8).

**Note**: This project was developed with the aid of Claude Code as part of experiments to learn how to make effective use of AI-assisted development tools.

## Features

- **ZIL Compiler**: Transforms ZIL source code into ZAP assembly language
- **Z-Machine Assembler**: Converts ZAP assembly into Z-Machine bytecode
- **Z-Machine Virtual Machine**: Executes Z-Machine story files for all versions
- **Unified CLI Tool**: Single `zil` command with multiple subcommands
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed diagnostics with source location tracking
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS)

## Architecture

The implementation consists of:

- **ZEngine Library**: Core functionality for compilation, assembly, and execution
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface with `build`, `run`, and `analyze` subcommands
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage using Swift Testing framework

### Z-Machine Version Support

| v8 | 256KB+ | Unicode support, modern extensions |

## Installation

### Requirements

- Swift 6.2 or later
- Xcode 26.0+ (for Apple platforms)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd swift-zil

# Build the project
swift build

# Run tests
swift test
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The `zil` tool provides three main commands:

#### Build Command
Compile ZIL source to Z-Machine bytecode:

```bash
swift run zil build [source] --output game.z5 --version 5
```

Options:
- `--output, -o`: Output file path
- `--assembly-only, -S`: Stop after compilation, output ZAP assembly only
- `--version`: Target Z-Machine version (3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- `--debug`: Generate debug symbols
- `--optimize`: Optimization level (0-2)

#### Run Command
Compile (if necessary) and launch game in Z-Machine VM:

```bash
swift run zil run [source] --debug
```

Options:
- `--debug`: Enable VM debug mode
- `--transcript`: Record gameplay transcript to file
- `--save-dir`: Directory for save games

#### Analyze Command
Analyze structure and content of Z-Machine story files:

```bash
swift run zil analyze [story-file] --all
```

Options:
- `--header`: Show story file header information
- `--objects`: Display object tree and properties
- `--dictionary`: Show parser dictionary contents
- `--strings`: List all strings and abbreviations
- `--routines`: Show routine table and disassembly
- `--memory`: Display memory layout and usage
- `--all`: Show all sections

## Language Support

### ZIL Language Features

ZIL is a Lisp-like domain-specific language for interactive fiction:

- S-expression syntax with `< >` brackets
- Objects with properties, flags, and hierarchical relationships
- Rooms with exits and descriptions
- Routines with local variables and control flow
- Global variables and constants
- Parser integration with syntax definitions
- Event system with interrupts and scheduling

### Example ZIL Code

```zil
<OBJECT LANTERN
    (IN LIVING-ROOM)
    (SYNONYM LAMP LANTERN LIGHT)
    (ADJECTIVE BRASS)
    (DESC "brass lantern")
    (FLAGS TAKEBIT LIGHTBIT)
    (ACTION LANTERN-F)>

<ROUTINE LANTERN-F ()
    <COND (<VERB? TAKE>
           <MOVE ,LANTERN ,PLAYER>
           <TELL "Taken." CR>)
          (<VERB? LIGHT>
           <FSET ,LANTERN ,ONBIT>
           <TELL "The lantern is now on." CR>)>>
```

## Current Status

**üîÑ LARGELY FUNCTIONAL** - The Swift ZIL toolchain has core functionality working across all components. The Z-Machine virtual machine successfully runs existing version 3 story files (proven with Zork I). The compiler and assembler can process valid input and produce correct output, but some ZIL language constructs remain unimplemented. Full end-to-end game compilation from ZIL source has not yet been demonstrated.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suite
swift test --filter ErrorHandlingTests
```

Test categories:
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Data structure validation
- Byte stream operations
- Utility function verification
- Z-Machine version compatibility
