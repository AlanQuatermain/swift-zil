# Z-Machine Opcodes Reference

This document lists the complete set of Z-Machine opcodes, their **mnemonics**, and their **semantics** (what the VM should do).  
Instructions are grouped by operand count/type (0OP, 1OP, 2OP, VAR, EXT).

---

## 0OP Instructions (no operands)

| Mnemonic | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `RTRUE` | Return from routine with value `true` (1). |
| `RFALSE` | Return from routine with value `false` (0). |
| `PRINT` | Print a literal Z-string embedded in the instruction stream. |
| `PRINT_RET` | Print a Z-string, then return `true`. |
| `NOP` | No operation (does nothing). |
| `RESTART` | Restart the game (reinitialize memory). |
| `RET_POPPED` | Return from routine with the top value popped from the evaluation stack. |
| `CATCH` | Push the current stack frame identifier for later use with `THROW`. |

| `VERIFY` | Perform checksum validation of story file, set branch accordingly. |

## VAR Instructions (variable operand count)

| Mnemonic | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CALL routine [args...] -> (result)` | Call routine with 0‚Äì3 arguments. |
| `CALL_VS routine [args...] -> (result)` | Call routine with up to 3 args (V4+). |

| `PUSH value` | Push value onto evaluation stack. |
| `POP var` | Pop from stack into variable. |
| `PULL var` | Opposite of `PUSH`: pop into variable. |
| `CHECK_ARG_COUNT count` | Branch if routine was called with ‚â• count args. |

# üîç Notes

- Branching instructions all follow the same convention: the instruction encodes a **branch offset** and whether to branch if true/false.
- The **stack**: local variables are accessed via var numbers; `SP` stack is used for temps.
- **Calls**: A ‚Äúroutine‚Äù is just a packed address in memory that contains local variable count + bytecode. Results go to a variable if specified.
- **Object tree**: objects form a linked tree with parent/child/sibling links and property tables.
- **I/O**: text output goes through the VM‚Äôs stream system; input is tokenized via the dictionary.
